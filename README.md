# multiplayer-card-game.....> To run the code, you can compile the Main.java file and then run the CardGame class. You can use any Java compiler, such as the javac command line tool or an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ.When you run the code, it will create a new CardGame instance and automatically deal 5 cards to each player and move the top card of the deck to the discard pile. Then, it will start the game by prompting the first player to play a card. The game will continue until a player has no more cards in their hand, at which point the game will end and the winner will be announced.
